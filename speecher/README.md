# Speech synthesis using swing and [processing](https://processing.org/) Video

This is a pretty basic seet of tools for Speech synthesis from video.

There are 2 tools:

## Editor
A tool that can be used to create SRT files of individual words in a video from the downloaded SRT files.

## Generator
A tool that can be used to re-sequence the subtitles to form new speech.

At the time of writing the Generator tool can hang a bit. :/ - it does work tho ... (woriking on it)

### Example 

[![Boris dont give a ...](http://img.youtube.com/vi/jab8l9LpbCg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jab8l9LpbCg "Boris dont give a ...")
