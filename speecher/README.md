# Speech synthesis using swing and [processing](https://processing.org/) Video

This is a pretty basic set of tools for Speech synthesis from video and SRT files.

There are 2 tools:

## Editor
A tool that can be used to create SRT files of individual words in a video from the downloaded SRT files.

## Generator
A tool that can be used to re-sequence the subtitles to form new speech.

At the time of writing the Generator tool can hang a bit. :/ - it does work tho ... (woriking on it)
