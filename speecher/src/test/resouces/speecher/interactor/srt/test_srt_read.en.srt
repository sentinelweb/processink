you expect to see an increase in
 

469
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:48,230
you expect to see an increase in
hospitalizations as well so the number

indicates from a month ago
 

483
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,829
indicates from a month ago
and you can see an increase in the

484
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:01,839
and you can see an increase in the
 

485
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,150
and you can see an increase in the
number of patients admitted to hospital

486
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,160
number of patients admitted to hospital
 

487
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,509
number of patients admitted to hospital
every day with kovid which is up towards

488
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
every day with kovid which is up towards
 

489
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,389
every day with kovid which is up towards
a thousand

490
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
a thousand
 

491
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,590
a thousand
now and with the numbers of infections

492
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
now and with the numbers of infections
 

493
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,350
now and with the numbers of infections
you'd expect that to continue to

494
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:13,360
you'd expect that to continue to
 

495
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,910
you'd expect that to continue to
increase

496
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
increase
 

497
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,710
increase
and it's worth remembering that the

498
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,720
and it's worth remembering that the
 

499
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,389
and it's worth remembering that the
number of infections

500
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:18,399
number of infections
 

501
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,870
number of infections
leads to hospitalizations a week or two

502
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:20,880
leads to hospitalizations a week or two
 

503
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,590
leads to hospitalizations a week or two
later

504
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
later
 

505
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,310
later
and that in turn has the effect of

506
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:24,320
and that in turn has the effect of
 

507
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,310
and that in turn has the effect of
increasing intensive care unit

508
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,320
increasing intensive care unit
 

509
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,790
increasing intensive care unit
numbers and of course unfortunately a

510
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
numbers and of course unfortunately a
 

511
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,550
numbers and of course unfortunately a
number of people will die as a result of

512
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:30,560
number of people will die as a result of
 

513
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,910
number of people will die as a result of
that and that will increase a week or

514
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
that and that will increase a week or
 

515
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,670
that and that will increase a week or
two after that so we expect to see a

516
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
two after that so we expect to see a
 

517
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,710
two after that so we expect to see a
delay

518
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:34,720
delay
 

519
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,590
delay
from the number of infections through to

520
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:36,600

reasons that care for other conditions
 

545
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,230
reasons that care for other conditions
like cardiovascular disease and oncology

like cardiovascular disease and oncology
 

547
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,190
like cardiovascular disease and oncology
cancer care gets affected is not the

the more the pressure on the healthcare

558
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:16,079
the more the pressure on the healthcare
 

559
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,990
the more the pressure on the healthcare
system overall and the more the

don't have the capacity to deal with it
 

567
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,269
don't have the capacity to deal with it
so it's very important to keep the

568
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
so it's very important to keep the
 

569
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,870
so it's very important to keep the
numbers of infections down

numbers of infections down
 

571
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,990
numbers of infections down
if we are to reduce the number of

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:37,670
from may through to now we're expecting
an

582
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:37,680
an
 

583
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,470
an
updated value for this tomorrow what you

584
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,480
updated value for this tomorrow what you
 

585
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,110
updated value for this tomorrow what you
can see

586
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,120
can see
 

587
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,509
can see
is r was very flat over the period of

588
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:43,519
is r was very flat over the period of
 

589
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,110
is r was very flat over the period of
the summer it was below 1

590
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
the summer it was below 1
 

591
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,590
the summer it was below 1
that means the epidemic is shrinking it

592
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:47,600
that means the epidemic is shrinking it
 

593
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,030
that means the epidemic is shrinking it
shrank over the period

594
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
shrank over the period
 

595
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,670
shrank over the period
up to august and then as measures were

596
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
up to august and then as measures were
 

597
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,590
up to august and then as measures were
released and people started to make more

598
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:53,600
released and people started to make more
 

599
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,230
released and people started to make more
contact

600
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,240
contact
 

601
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,790
contact
you can see that the r increased and

602
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:56,800
you can see that the r increased and
 

603
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,630
you can see that the r increased and
it's gone up to somewhere between

604
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
it's gone up to somewhere between
 

605
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,069
it's gone up to somewhere between
1.2 to 1.5 something like that

606
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
1.2 to 1.5 something like that
 

607
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,550
1.2 to 1.5 something like that
so it's about half of the natural r

608
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:04,560
so it's about half of the natural r
 

609
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,269
so it's about half of the natural r
which is around

610
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
which is around
 

611
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,310
which is around
three so it's definitely reflects

612
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
three so it's definitely reflects
 

613
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,870
three so it's definitely reflects
the huge effort that people have made to

614
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:10,880
the huge effort that people have made to
 

615
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,509
the huge effort that people have made to
try to

616
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
try to
 

617
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,990
try to
adhere to the various measures that are

618
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:14,000
adhere to the various measures that are
 

619
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,750
adhere to the various measures that are
in place the fact that we're wearing

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
in place the fact that we're wearing
 

621
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,350
in place the fact that we're wearing
masks we're keeping a distance we're

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,230
washing our hands we're doing the things
that we need to do

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:20,240
that we need to do
 

627
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,150
that we need to do
to try and reduce it has brought the r

628
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
to try and reduce it has brought the r
 

629
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,550
to try and reduce it has brought the r
down but this also means

630
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
down but this also means
 

631
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,710
down but this also means
that the epidemic is still growing as

632
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
that the epidemic is still growing as
 

633
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,069
that the epidemic is still growing as
long as r is above

634
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:28,079
long as r is above
 

635
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,030
long as r is above
one the epidemic continues to grow and

636
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
one the epidemic continues to grow and
 

637
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,550
one the epidemic continues to grow and
it will continue to grow

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:34,560

 

639
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,470

at a reasonable rate it's doubling

at a reasonable rate it's doubling
 

641
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,590
at a reasonable rate it's doubling
perhaps every 14 to 18 days

perhaps every 14 to 18 days
 

643
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,389
perhaps every 14 to 18 days
unless the r comes below one so that is

00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
unless the r comes below one so that is

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,230
the a and i do want to just say
there are some areas where we begin to

648
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:46,240
there are some areas where we begin to
 

649
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,350
there are some areas where we begin to
see

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:47,360
see
 

651
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,910

the rates are coming down or flattening

658
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
the rates are coming down or flattening
 

659
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,990
the rates are coming down or flattening
off a bit again

660
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
off a bit again
 

661
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,750
off a bit again
due to the huge efforts that people have

662
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
due to the huge efforts that people have
 

663
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,550
due to the huge efforts that people have
made to try to adhere to these

made to try to adhere to these
 

665
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,069
made to try to adhere to these
changes in behaviors that we need to

have in order to get this down
 

669
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,590
have in order to get this down
and in some areas of the country we can

670
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:05,600
and in some areas of the country we can
 

671
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,190
and in some areas of the country we can
begin to see a little bit of flattening

672
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
begin to see a little bit of flattening
 

673
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,910
begin to see a little bit of flattening
possibly

674
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:07,920
possibly
 

675
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,150
possibly
so the measures are having an effect but

676
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
so the measures are having an effect but
 

677
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,949
so the measures are having an effect but
we need to do

678
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
we need to do
 

679
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,670
we need to do
more if the aim is to get our below one

680
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:13,680
more if the aim is to get our below one
 

681
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,710
more if the aim is to get our below one
and to shrink

682
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:14,720

is the
picture that we've shown before on the

692
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,120
picture that we've shown before on the
 

693
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,509
picture that we've shown before on the
left hand side the darker the purple the

694
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
left hand side the darker the purple the
 

695
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,190
left hand side the darker the purple the
higher the case numbers

696
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
higher the case numbers
 

697
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,389
higher the case numbers
what you can see is uh the entire

698
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
what you can see is uh the entire
 

699
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,470
what you can see is uh the entire
entirety of england is now purple so

700
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,480
entirety of england is now purple so
 

701
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,990
entirety of england is now purple so
that there are cases everywhere

702
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:34,000
that there are cases everywhere
 

703
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,990
that there are cases everywhere
increasing and some areas have got very

704
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
increasing and some areas have got very
 

705
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,590
increasing and some areas have got very
high numbers which if r stayed at one

706
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
high numbers which if r stayed at one
 

707
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,230
high numbers which if r stayed at one
those would stay at very high numbers on

708
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,240
those would stay at very high numbers on
 

709
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,829
those would stay at very high numbers on
the right hand side

710
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:45,839
the right hand side
 

711
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,310
the right hand side
is the speed with which growth is

712
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
is the speed with which growth is
 

713
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,190
is the speed with which growth is
occurring

714
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
occurring
 

715
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,509
occurring
so where it's brown the numbers are

716
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
so where it's brown the numbers are
 

717
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,750
so where it's brown the numbers are
increasing and the darker the brown the

718
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
increasing and the darker the brown the
 

719
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,110
increasing and the darker the brown the
greater the increase

720
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
greater the increase
 

721
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,829
greater the increase
so again in some areas this has slowed

722
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
so again in some areas this has slowed
 

723
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,110
so again in some areas this has slowed
down a bit

724
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,120
down a bit
 

725
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,110
down a bit
the rate of growth isn't as high as it

726
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
the rate of growth isn't as high as it
 

727
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,629
the rate of growth isn't as high as it
was in some areas

728
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
was in some areas
 

729
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,990
was in some areas
but overall this is growing continues to

730
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
but overall this is growing continues to
 

731
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,710
but overall this is growing continues to
grow

732
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:06,720
grow
 

733
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,710
grow
r is above one and therefore we should

734
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:08,720
r is above one and therefore we should
 

735
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,829
r is above one and therefore we should
expect to see

736
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
expect to see
 

737
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,829

speak to anyone in this industry they're
 

1271
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,630
speak to anyone in this industry they're
seeing it in their numbers quite

1272
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
seeing it in their numbers quite
 

1273
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,630
seeing it in their numbers quite
um quite significantly over the past few

1274
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,640
um quite significantly over the past few
 

1275
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,230
um quite significantly over the past few
weeks and and that's why

1276
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:18,240
weeks and and that's why
 

1277
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,750
weeks and and that's why
you know as we've always said we will

1278
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:19,760
you know as we've always said we will
 

1279
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,990
you know as we've always said we will
adapt and evolve our response as the

1280
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
adapt and evolve our response as the
 

1281
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,070
adapt and evolve our response as the
situation changes now as the health

1282
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:24,080
situation changes now as the health
 

1283
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,590
situation changes now as the health
restrictions have changed and that's had

1284
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:25,600
restrictions have changed and that's had
 

1285
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,909
restrictions have changed and that's had
an impact on the economy i think it's

1286
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:27,919
an impact on the economy i think it's
 

1287
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,310
an impact on the economy i think it's
right

1288
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,320
right
 

1289
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,549
right
that we respond pragmatically and

1290
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
that we respond pragmatically and
 

1291
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,149
that we respond pragmatically and
flexibly to that because ultimately what

1292
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
flexibly to that because ultimately what
 

1293
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,270
flexibly to that because ultimately what
we're trying to do

1294
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:33,280
we're trying to do
 

1295
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,070
we're trying to do
is protect people's jobs and income and

1296
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080
is protect people's jobs and income and
 

1297
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:36,390
is protect people's jobs and income and
the

1298
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:36,400
the
 

1299
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,070
the
measures that we've put in place today

1300
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,080
measures that we've put in place today
 

1301
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,430
measures that we've put in place today
i'm confident will do

1302
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
i'm confident will do
 

1303
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,149
i'm confident will do
just that and this will be now in place

1304
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:42,159
just that and this will be now in place
 

1305
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,669
just that and this will be now in place
for a while to come and i think it's

1306
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:43,679
for a while to come and i think it's
 

1307
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,950
for a while to come and i think it's
very generous and effective support

1308
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:46,960
very generous and effective support
 

1309
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,270
very generous and effective support
uh i think the numbers speak for

1310
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
uh i think the numbers speak for
 

1311
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,549
uh i think the numbers speak for
themselves they're increasing

1312
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
themselves they're increasing
 

1313
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,390
themselves they're increasing
and um they're not going to decrease

1314
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
and um they're not going to decrease
 

1315
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,470
and um they're not going to decrease
quickly and i think it's likely that

1316
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:54,480
quickly and i think it's likely that
 

1317
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:54,950
quickly and i think it's likely that
some

1318
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
some
 

1319
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,630
some
measures of restriction are going to

1320
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:56,640
measures of restriction are going to
 

1321
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,549
measures of restriction are going to
need to be in place for a while to try

1322
00:21:58,549 --> 00:21:58,559
need to be in place for a while to try
 

1323
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,029
need to be in place for a while to try
and get

1324
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
and get
 

1325
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,750
and get
those numbers down obviously the quicker

1326
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:01,760
those numbers down obviously the quicker
 

1327
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,590
those numbers down obviously the quicker
you get the r below one

1328
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:03,600
you get the r below one
 

1329
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,149
you get the r below one
the quicker numbers come down and things

1330
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:06,159
the quicker numbers come down and things
 

1331
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,669
the quicker numbers come down and things
then give a bit of room

1332
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
then give a bit of room
 

1333
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,310
then give a bit of room
and so a lot depends on what happens now

1334
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:10,320
and so a lot depends on what happens now
 

1335
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,990
and so a lot depends on what happens now
over the next few weeks

1336
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
over the next few weeks
 

1337
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,750
over the next few weeks
at the moment the numbers are headed in

1338
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:13,760
at the moment the numbers are headed in
 

1339
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,350
at the moment the numbers are headed in
the wrong direction but as i say there

1340
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
the wrong direction but as i say there
 

1341
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,630
the wrong direction but as i say there
are some signs

1342
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:16,640
are some signs
 

1343
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,029
are some signs
in some places of a potential flattening

1344
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
in some places of a potential flattening
 

1345
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,710
in some places of a potential flattening
off of that and we need to wait and see

1346
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:20,720
off of that and we need to wait and see
 

1347
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,990
off of that and we need to wait and see
and monitor the numbers very very

1348
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:22,000
and monitor the numbers very very
 

1349
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,750
and monitor the numbers very very
carefully well

oh sorry patrick yes um so on the on the

1580
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,120
oh sorry patrick yes um so on the on the
 

1581
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,390
oh sorry patrick yes um so on the on the
uh test and trace um it it's

1582
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:18,400
uh test and trace um it it's
 

1583
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,149
uh test and trace um it it's
undoubtedly the case that test trace and

1584
00:26:20,149 --> 00:26:20,159
undoubtedly the case that test trace and
 

1585
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,230
undoubtedly the case that test trace and
isolation becomes much more difficult to

1586
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,240
isolation becomes much more difficult to
 

1587
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,549
isolation becomes much more difficult to
have an

1588
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:22,559
have an
 

1589
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,029
have an
impact once numbers are high so it's

1590
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:25,039
impact once numbers are high so it's
 

1591
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,630
impact once numbers are high so it's
much more effective when numbers are low

1592
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
much more effective when numbers are low
 

1593
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,390
much more effective when numbers are low
that's the first point

1594
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,400
that's the first point
 

1595
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,710
that's the first point
the second point is that i think the

1596
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:30,720
the second point is that i think the
 

1597
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,710
the second point is that i think the
testing system has ramped up the numbers

1598
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:32,720
testing system has ramped up the numbers
 

1599
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,630
testing system has ramped up the numbers
they're able to do quite effectively

1600
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
they're able to do quite effectively
 

1601
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,950
they're able to do quite effectively
but it's really important to concentrate

1602
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:36,960
but it's really important to concentrate
 

1603
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,230
but it's really important to concentrate
on numbers of

1604
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:38,240
on numbers of
 

1605
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,190
on numbers of
contacts isolation as quickly as you can

1606
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,200
contacts isolation as quickly as you can
 

1607
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,029
contacts isolation as quickly as you can
and getting things back as quickly as

1608
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:43,039
and getting things back as quickly as
 

1609
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,630
and getting things back as quickly as
you can ideally to get the whole process

1610
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
you can ideally to get the whole process
 

1611
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,470
you can ideally to get the whole process
done within 48 hours

1612
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:46,480
done within 48 hours
 

1613
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,310
done within 48 hours
and it's very clear there's room for

1614
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:48,320
and it's very clear there's room for
 

1615
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,669
and it's very clear there's room for
improvement on all of that and therefore

1616
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
improvement on all of that and therefore
 

1617
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:50,710
improvement on all of that and therefore
that will be diminishing the

1618
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:50,720
that will be diminishing the
 

1619
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,830
that will be diminishing the
effectiveness of this but the

1620
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:51,840
effectiveness of this but the
 

1621
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,350
effectiveness of this but the
effectiveness anyway

1622
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:53,360
effectiveness anyway
 

1623
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,750
effectiveness anyway
of test and trace is less when numbers

1624
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
of test and trace is less when numbers
 

1625
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,710
of test and trace is less when numbers
are high than it is when numbers are low

1626
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720
are high than it is when numbers are low
 

1627
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:05,029
are high than it is when numbers are low
thanks very much as ben kentish of lbc

south korea germany and taiwan have
 

1643
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,710
south korea germany and taiwan have
shown that there is an alternative

1644
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:18,720
shown that there is an alternative
 

1645
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,549
shown that there is an alternative
to the sort of restrictions that much of

1646
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:20,559
to the sort of restrictions that much of
 

1647
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,549
to the sort of restrictions that much of
the uk is now under and that is a

1648
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:22,559
the uk is now under and that is a
 

1649
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,389
the uk is now under and that is a
functioning test and trace system

1650
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:24,399
functioning test and trace system
 

1651
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,990
functioning test and trace system
uh we're testing more people than ever

1652
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,000
uh we're testing more people than ever
 

1653
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,830
uh we're testing more people than ever
but clearly something's going wrong for

1654
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:27,840
but clearly something's going wrong for
 

1655
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,710
but clearly something's going wrong for
example

1656
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:28,720
example
 

1657
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,149
example
in june prime minister you said you

1658
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:30,159
in june prime minister you said you
 

1659
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,149
in june prime minister you said you
wanted a hundred percent of test results

1660
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:32,159
wanted a hundred percent of test results
 

1661
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:32,789
wanted a hundred percent of test results
to be back

1662
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:32,799
to be back
 

1663
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,350
to be back
within 24 hours today the current figure

1664
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:35,360
within 24 hours today the current figure
 

1665
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,789
within 24 hours today the current figure
is just 15

1666
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
is just 15
 

1667
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,630
is just 15
so what do you think's gone wrong there

1668
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:38,640
so what do you think's gone wrong there
 

1669
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,310
so what do you think's gone wrong there
and when can you assure the british

1670
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,320
and when can you assure the british
 

1671
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,029
and when can you assure the british
public

1672

that that system will be effective

1674
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
that that system will be effective
 

1675
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,110
that that system will be effective

is improving the whole time but the

00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:05,840
is improving the whole time but the
 

1755
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,950
is improving the whole time but the
crucial thing

1756
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:06,960
crucial thing
 

1757
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,510
crucial thing
to get nhs test and trace to work is

1758
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:09,520
to get nhs test and trace to work is
 

1759
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,470
to get nhs test and trace to work is
that if you

1760
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:10,480
that if you
 

1761
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,909
that if you
test positive then you've got to

1762
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:13,919
test positive then you've got to
 

1763
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,230
test positive then you've got to
to self-isolate and don't forget that

1764
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:16,240
to self-isolate and don't forget that
 

1765
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,029
to self-isolate and don't forget that
there's a

1766
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,039
there's a
 

1767
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,230
there's a
uh you know 500 pounds to help you with

1768
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:20,240
uh you know 500 pounds to help you with
 

1769
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,430
uh you know 500 pounds to help you with
the cost of that

1770
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:21,440
the cost of that
 

1771
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,389
the cost of that
but also a 10 000 pound fine for for not

1772
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:24,399
but also a 10 000 pound fine for for not
 

1773
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,070
but also a 10 000 pound fine for for not
doing so the thing depends

1774
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
doing so the thing depends
 

1775
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,950
doing so the thing depends
on people self-isolating and breaking uh

1776
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:28,960
on people self-isolating and breaking uh
 

1777

the transmission it is helping a bit
 

1781
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,470
the transmission it is helping a bit
already to

already to
 

1783
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,149
already to
to break uh the transmission about a

1784
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:34,159
to break uh the transmission about a

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,830
to break uh the transmission about a
million people uh

unprecedented increase in borrowing

unprecedented increase in borrowing
 

1803
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,950
unprecedented increase in borrowing
that's happening this year and the

1804
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:56,960
that's happening this year and the
 

1805
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,710
that's happening this year and the
consequent rise in our debt levels to

consequent rise in our debt levels to
 

1807
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,830

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,310
close to 100
of debt to gdp and as you said those are

00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,320
of debt to gdp and as you said those are
 

1811
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,470

unprecedented numbers at unprecedented

times
 

1815
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,350
times
now whilst it is right to act i think

1816
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,360
now whilst it is right to act i think
 

1817
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,549
now whilst it is right to act i think
with scale

1818
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:08,559
with scale
 

1819
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,070
with scale
during a crisis like this to try and

1820
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,080
during a crisis like this to try and
 

1821
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,430
during a crisis like this to try and
protect jobs and employment and

1822
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:11,440
protect jobs and employment and
 

1823
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,070
protect jobs and employment and
ultimately

1824
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,080
ultimately
 

1825
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,510
ultimately
that will protect our economy in the

1826
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:13,520
that will protect our economy in the
 

1827
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,750
that will protect our economy in the
long run it's also right that because of

1828
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:15,760
long run it's also right that because of
 

1829
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,590
long run it's also right that because of
those numbers that you highlighted that

1830
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:17,600
those numbers that you highlighted that
 

1831
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,110
those numbers that you highlighted that
we always have one eye

1832
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,120
we always have one eye
 

1833
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,190
we always have one eye
on the long-term public finances because

1834
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,200
on the long-term public finances because
 

1835
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,950
on the long-term public finances because
we want to make sure that we are careful

1836
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:22,960
we want to make sure that we are careful
 

1837
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,590
we want to make sure that we are careful
with that

1838
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:23,600
with that
 

1839
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,389
with that
it's clearly not sustainable to carry on

1840
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:26,399
it's clearly not sustainable to carry on
 

1841
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,590
it's clearly not sustainable to carry on
acting in this way

1842
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
acting in this way
 

1843
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,470
acting in this way
forever so as we continue intervening in

1844
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
forever so as we continue intervening in
 

1845
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,269
forever so as we continue intervening in
the economy

1846
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:31,279
the economy
 

1847
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,350
the economy
it's right that that is targeted and

1848
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,360
it's right that that is targeted and

because we're going to have to pay this
money back

uh once as you say uh we we get the
 

2047
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,190
uh once as you say uh we we get the
virus uh

2048

virus uh
 

2049
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,909
virus uh
back under control um and that's and

2050
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:27,919
back under control um and that's and
 

2051
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:28,549
back under control um and that's and
that's the

2052
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:28,559
that's the
 

2053
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,430
that's the
objective and uh you know i think that

2054
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:31,440
objective and uh you know i think that
 

2055
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,710
objective and uh you know i think that
if you look at the

2056
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:32,720
if you look at the
 

2057
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,110
if you look at the
uh the way the science is changing and

2058
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:35,120
uh the way the science is changing and
 

2059
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,149
uh the way the science is changing and
you look at the

2060
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:36,159
you look at the
 

2061
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,350
you look at the
uh the improvements in

2062
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,360
uh the improvements in
 

2063
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,710

um look at the changes we're seeing in
 

2069
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,750
um look at the changes we're seeing in
and the improvements in

00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:47,760
and the improvements in
 

2071
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,549
and the improvements in
uh in you know some some changes in in

2072

uh in you know some some changes in in
 

2073
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,669
uh in you know some some changes in in
the mortality rates

2074
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:51,679
the mortality rates
 

2075
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,430
the mortality rates
i i am confident that we will get

2076
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:53,440
i i am confident that we will get
 

2077
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,029
i i am confident that we will get
through this very well

2078
00:33:55,029 --> 00:33:55,039
through this very well
 

2079
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,750
through this very well
in due course but for the moment uh and

improvements in testing technologies
 

2083
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,389
improvements in testing technologies
uh as i said uh last week really

2084
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:02,399
uh as i said uh last week really
 

2085
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,590
uh as i said uh last week really
interesting improvements in testing

2086
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
interesting improvements in testing
 

2087
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,310
interesting improvements in testing

technologies
 

2089
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,110
technologies
but for the moment we have to use uh the

2090
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,120
but for the moment we have to use uh the
 

2091
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,830
but for the moment we have to use uh the
same

2092
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
same
 

2093
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,109
same
tools that uh we've got which is uh the

2094

tools that uh we've got which is uh the
 

2095
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,389
tools that uh we've got which is uh the

social distancing
 

2097
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,270

restrictions that
 

2101
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,310
restrictions that
we put in place and we have to do that

2102
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,320
we put in place and we have to do that
 

2103
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,230
we put in place and we have to do that
at a local and a regional

2104
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:20,240
at a local and a regional
 

2105
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,230

age groups seem to be doing
 

2121
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,349
age groups seem to be doing
across the country then you know we will

2122
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:37,359
across the country then you know we will
 

2123
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,389
across the country then you know we will
drive that r

2124
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:38,399
drive that r
 

2125
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,149
drive that r
down again and we will get it under

2126
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:40,159
down again and we will get it under
 

2127
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,510
down again and we will get it under
control and in the meantime

2128
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
control and in the meantime
 

2129
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,990
control and in the meantime
we would have supported our businesses

2130
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:44,000
we would have supported our businesses
 

2131
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,030
we would have supported our businesses

better position
 

2137
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,710
better position
to come out of it that's that's what

2138
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:50,720
to come out of it that's that's what
 

2139
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,550
to come out of it that's that's what
we're doing uh patrick

we're doing uh patrick
 

2141
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,069
we're doing uh patrick
on vaccines i think you know things are

2142
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:54,079
on vaccines i think you know things are
 

2143
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,829
on vaccines i think you know things are
progressing well there are vaccines that

2144
00:34:55,829 --> 00:34:55,839
progressing well there are vaccines that
 

2145
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,670
progressing well there are vaccines that
produce an immune response they're in

2146
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:57,680
produce an immune response they're in
 

2147
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,589
produce an immune response they're in
phase three clinical trials we should be

2148
00:34:59,589 --> 00:34:59,599
phase three clinical trials we should be
 

2149
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,190
phase three clinical trials we should be
seeing some data readouts over the

2150
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
seeing some data readouts over the
 

2151
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,550
seeing some data readouts over the
course of this year

2152
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560
course of this year
 

2153
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,270
course of this year
but i remain of the view that the

2154
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:05,280
but i remain of the view that the
 

2155
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,030
but i remain of the view that the
possibility of sort of wider spread use

2156
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,040
possibility of sort of wider spread use
 

2157
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,630
possibility of sort of wider spread use
of vaccines isn't going to be until

2158
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:08,640
of vaccines isn't going to be until
 

2159
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,670
of vaccines isn't going to be until
spring or so next

2160
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:09,680
spring or so next
 

2161
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,829
spring or so next
next year by the time we get enough

2162
00:35:11,829 --> 00:35:11,839
next year by the time we get enough
 

2163
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:13,109
next year by the time we get enough
doses and enough

2164
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:13,119
doses and enough
 

2165
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,190
doses and enough
understanding of the outputs to to use

2166
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:15,200
understanding of the outputs to to use
 

2167
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,950
understanding of the outputs to to use
them now we may get a few doses this

2168
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
them now we may get a few doses this
 

2169
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,829
them now we may get a few doses this
side of christmas

2170
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:17,839
side of christmas
 

2171
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:19,829
side of christmas
maybe something could happen but i think

2172
00:35:19,829 --> 00:35:19,839
maybe something could happen but i think
 

2173
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:21,510
maybe something could happen but i think
we should more realistically be looking

2174
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:21,520
we should more realistically be looking
 

2175
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,630
we should more realistically be looking
at spring and of course there are no

2176
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:22,640
at spring and of course there are no
 

2177
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,910
at spring and of course there are no
guarantees until

2178
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:23,920
guarantees until

or do you think that those measures are

2526
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:47,359
or do you think that those measures are
 

2527
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,950
or do you think that those measures are
going to be in place for much of the

going to be in place for much of the

in wales and northern ireland are shown
 

2535
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,829
in wales and northern ireland are shown
to be more effective

uh which some of your own advisers have
 

2541
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,069
uh which some of your own advisers have
said are useless

2542

said are useless
 

2543
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,349
said are useless
will you change your mind

2544
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:07,359

 

2545
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,030

well i'm not going to speculate on how

2546
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,040
well i'm not going to speculate on how
 

2547
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,550
well i'm not going to speculate on how
effective the vaccines are going to be

2548
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
effective the vaccines are going to be
 

2549
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,069
effective the vaccines are going to be
we will see the readout from the

2550
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:12,079
we will see the readout from the
 

2551
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,670
we will see the readout from the
clinical trials over

2552
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:13,680
clinical trials over
 

2553
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,349
clinical trials over
the next months we'll see some i hope

2554
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:15,359
the next months we'll see some i hope
 

2555
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:16,870
the next months we'll see some i hope
within the next

2556
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:16,880
within the next
 

2557
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,230
within the next
couple of months we should start seeing

2558
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,240
couple of months we should start seeing
 

2559
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,069
couple of months we should start seeing
outcomes once we know how effective

2560
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:20,079
outcomes once we know how effective
 

2561
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,589
outcomes once we know how effective
the vaccines are then and how

2562
00:41:23,589 --> 00:41:23,599
the vaccines are then and how
 

2563
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,430
the vaccines are then and how
applicable they are to different groups

2564
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:25,440
applicable they are to different groups
 

2565
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,430
applicable they are to different groups
then you can start working out

2566
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:27,440
then you can start working out
 

2567
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,910
then you can start working out
how to use them best but you can't do

2568
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:29,920
how to use them best but you can't do
 

2569
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,270
how to use them best but you can't do
that until you've seen the results of

2570
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:31,280
that until you've seen the results of
 

2571
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,550
that until you've seen the results of
safety and efficacy

2572
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:32,560
safety and efficacy
 

2573
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,230
safety and efficacy
and when you see that you can then start

2574
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,240
and when you see that you can then start
 

2575
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,990
and when you see that you can then start
to judge what impact that's going to

2576
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,000
to judge what impact that's going to
 

2577
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,470
to judge what impact that's going to
have but clearly the aim of vaccination

2578
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:38,480
have but clearly the aim of vaccination
 

2579
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,510
have but clearly the aim of vaccination
is to try to take most of the load of

2580
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:41,520
is to try to take most of the load of
 

2581
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,470
is to try to take most of the load of
of the infection spread onto the vaccine

2582
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:44,480
of the infection spread onto the vaccine
 

2583
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,910
of the infection spread onto the vaccine
in order to be able to release other

2584
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
in order to be able to release other
 

2585
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,270
in order to be able to release other
measures and that's got to be

2586
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:47,280
measures and that's got to be
 

2587
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,750
measures and that's got to be
an aim that we would all wish for and

2588
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:49,760
an aim that we would all wish for and
 

2589
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,710
an aim that we would all wish for and
that's why

2590
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:50,720
that's why
 

2591
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,230
that's why
so many companies around the world are

2592
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:52,240
so many companies around the world are
 

2593
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,910
so many companies around the world are
working on vaccines and why there's been

2594
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:53,920
working on vaccines and why there's been
 

2595
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,990
working on vaccines and why there's been
such remarkable progress and

2596
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,000
such remarkable progress and
 

2597
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,710
such remarkable progress and
it is remarkable if you look at um

2598
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:58,720
it is remarkable if you look at um
 

2599
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,030
it is remarkable if you look at um
history up till now

2600
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
history up till now
 

2601
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,870
history up till now
vaccines have never been made in

2602
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:02,880
vaccines have never been made in
 

2603
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,950
vaccines have never been made in
anything like this time frame it's been

2604
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:04,960
anything like this time frame it's been
 

2605
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,430
anything like this time frame it's been
at least five years and so to be where

2606
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
at least five years and so to be where
 

2607
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,150
at least five years and so to be where
we are now is remarkable

2608
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,160
we are now is remarkable
 

2609
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,630
we are now is remarkable
uh thanks very much well i mean i really

2612
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:13,680
hope that we do make
 

2613
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,069
hope that we do make
uh progress with uh vaccines like you

2614
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:16,079
uh progress with uh vaccines like you
 

2615
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:16,870
uh progress with uh vaccines like you
know i i

2616
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:16,880
know i i

so optimistic if i can put it out that

2620
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,040
so optimistic if i can put it out that
 

2621
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,510
so optimistic if i can put it out that
way

2622
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,520
way
 

2623
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,270
way
uh about them um you know i but we can't

2624
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:25,280
uh about them um you know i but we can't
 

2625
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,349
uh about them um you know i but we can't
jen in my view rely on that we've got to

2626
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
jen in my view rely on that we've got to
 

2627
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,630
jen in my view rely on that we've got to
keep going uh

2628
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:28,640
keep going uh
 

2629
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,270
keep going uh
it may happen uh we're working flat out

2630
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:31,280
it may happen uh we're working flat out
 

2631
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,309
it may happen uh we're working flat out
to ensure that it does

2632
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:32,319
to ensure that it does
 

2633
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,190
to ensure that it does
uh but we we can't just count on that uh

2634
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
uh but we we can't just count on that uh
 

2635
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,630
uh but we we can't just count on that uh
and that's why we have to

2636
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:36,640
and that's why we have to
 

2637
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,790
and that's why we have to
do all the other things that that we're

2638
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:38,800
do all the other things that that we're
 

2639
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,910
do all the other things that that we're
doing and

2640
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:39,920
doing and
 

2641
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,230
doing and
um you know you ask the the the same

2642
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:42,240
um you know you ask the the the same
 

2643
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,270
um you know you ask the the the same
question everybody really

2644
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:43,280
question everybody really
 

2645
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,670
question everybody really
is asking should we just go back into

2646
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:45,680
is asking should we just go back into
 

2647
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,030
is asking should we just go back into
another national

2648
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,040
another national
 

2649
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,230
another national
lockdown and then uh you know possibly

2650
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:50,240
lockdown and then uh you know possibly
 

2651
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,550
lockdown and then uh you know possibly
have

2652
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:50,560
have
 

2653
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,589
have
an another one after that and another

2654
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:53,599
an another one after that and another
 

2655
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,309
an another one after that and another
one

2656
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:54,319
one
 

2657
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,309
one
after that and i think that that really

2658
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:56,319
after that and i think that that really
 

2659
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,510
after that and i think that that really
would be economically

2660
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:57,520
would be economically
 

2661
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,390
would be economically
uh socially uh psychologically really

2662
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:00,400
uh socially uh psychologically really
 

2663
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,990
uh socially uh psychologically really
very damaging and difficult for

2664
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,000
very damaging and difficult for
 

2665
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,589
very damaging and difficult for
for the country we all remember what it

2666
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
for the country we all remember what it
 

2667
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,589
for the country we all remember what it
was like in uh in march

2668
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:05,599
was like in uh in march
 

2669
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,349
was like in uh in march
and april uh there were lots of costs

2670
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:07,359
and april uh there were lots of costs
 

2671
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:08,950
and april uh there were lots of costs
particularly costs to uh

2672
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:08,960
particularly costs to uh
 

2673
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,030
particularly costs to uh
