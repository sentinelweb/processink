# Processink
Kotlin based processing sketches

This is some tests patches using kotlin to make processing sketches (using Intellij project)

## Subprojects (modules)
- [first](https://github.com/sentinelweb/processink/tree/master/first) - test patches Video, GLSL, and other utils
- [TextWorld](https://github.com/sentinelweb/processink/tree/master/text_world) - a patch that render text and some cubes over GLSL backgrounds
- [speecher](https://github.com/sentinelweb/processink/tree/master/speecher) - Speech synthesis from videos and SRT files

# Conclusion
My overall opinion is that kotlin is great for this sort of work - it very fluid and a. muchj better choice for Procesing than Java while still having full functionality of the processing libraries
